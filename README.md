# getting-started
Hi! Here's the first step for you to get started on learning Python! First, you'll need to do is get started on setting up the software on your laptop in order to learn Python!

## Setting up Git
Depending on if your computer runs on Windows or Mac, you will have to install Git in order to make changes to the repositories on GitHub. 

## Set up your GitHub account
Go to this website and set up your account here https://github.com/

### If you have a Mac
Follow these instructions here: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#mac-os-x

### If you have a PC
1. Open this link (http://gitforwindows.org/) and click on the button that says "Download"
2. Run the file you just downloaded, "Git-2.14.1-64-bit.exe"
3. Once the installer is running, go through all of installation using all of the default options
4. After you've finished installing, open up Powershell. Type in "git" and if it's running correctly, it should look like this:

## Setting up Python

### If you have a Mac
Go to this link (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-362/)and download the Mac OS X version. Click on the file you just downloaded and continue through the installation process. After you're done, open up terminal and enter "python3"

For future purposes, you'll need to navigate on your computer (in Finder) to `Applications/Python 3.6` and double-click `Install Certificates.command`

### If you have a PC
Go to this link (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-362/) and click on "Windows x86-64 executable installer". Run the file you installed, " python-3.6.2.ex". Make sure to check the box next to Add Python 3.6 to PATH" or "Add to environment variable".
When you're done, open up PowerShell and type "python" to see if it works.

## Setting up your text editor
Text editors are where you'll be doing most of your coding. Sublime text (http://www.sublimetext.com/) is a good one, but before you run any code, you will have to go to terminal and type in "python3 filename"
PyCharm is also a good one. If you want to do this one instead of Sublime Text, sit down with me and I can walk you through downloading it!

## Running your first program
Once you've gotten everything set up, clone this repository. In the corner of this repository, there is a green button that says "Clone or download". Once you click on it, there should be a link. Copy the link, open up your terminal and navigate to the location that you want to keep all of your files. Then, type in "git clone (link here)". Open the folder where you have it and the files in the repository should be in a folder with the same name as the repository.

Now, follow all the steps in the python file (python files all end in ".py"). Once you're done, follow these steps to turn it in:

1. Navigate to the folder you just cloned on terminal
2. Type in "git add ." and press enter to register the changes
3. Type in "git commit -m (add message here)" to see what changes you've made 
4. Type in "git push" to apply your changes
