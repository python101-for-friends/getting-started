Hi Kaiden! Here's the first step for you to get started on learning Python! First, you'll need to do is get started on setting up the software on your laptop in order to learn Python!

### If you have a Mac
Go to this link (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-362/)and download the Mac OS X version. Click on the file you just downloaded and continue through the installation process. After you're done, open up terminal and enter "python3"

For future purposes, you'll need to navigate on your computer (in Finder) to `Applications/Python 3.6` and double-click `Install Certificates.command`
