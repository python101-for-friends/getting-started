# if you are using Windows or type "python3 hw0.py" if you are using MacOS

# In order to print something, type in:

# Try it out yourself by printing a poem of your choice below:

# After you're done printing your poem, let's try playing around with variables. To set up a variable, type in:

variable = 1

# You can use operators such as "+", "-", "*", or "/" to change variables.
# Now you're going to print the area of a box using variables. Set the values of the print variables down here:

width = # Variable here
height = # Variable here

print("The area of the box is " + width * height)
